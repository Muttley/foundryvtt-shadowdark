## Live reload
Do you develop and want to have live reloading with the changes in Javascript?

The Watch npm script includes a gulp-livereload server, and can communicate with the Livereload chrome extention.

To get the plugin working, you need to:
- Get plugin : https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en
- Go into plugin settings and set: "Allow access to file URLs" to ON
