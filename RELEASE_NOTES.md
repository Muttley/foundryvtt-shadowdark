## Feature Notes

### Support for Module Defined Sources

Module creators can add their own custom source names which will become available in the system by creating a custom config section to the `flags` section of their `module.json` configuration file.  For example:

```json
"flags": {
	"shadowdark": {
		"sources": {
			"<source_uuid>": "<source_name>"
		}
	}
}
```

Where `<source_uuid>` is a unique identifier for your custom source, and `<source_name>` is the human readable/display name of your source.
