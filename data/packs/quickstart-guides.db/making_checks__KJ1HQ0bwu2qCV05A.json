		"content": "<h2>When to Roll?</h2><p>Usually, you succeed at what you're trained to do without needing to roll a check.</p><p>For example, a wizard is always able to read magical runes, and a thief always finds a trap if searching in the right area.</p><p>If you take the time to scan the sky for threats or examine a stretch of wall for a secret door, you simply succeed.</p><p><strong>Social encounters</strong> usually rely on what you say rather than Charisma checks. Narrating a moving speech or using secret information you gathered to influence an NPC does not require a check to succeed.</p><p>The GM asks for a check when the following is true:</p><ul><li><p>The action has a <strong>negative consequence</strong> for failure</p></li><li><p>The action requires <strong>skill</strong></p></li><li><p>There is <strong>time pressure</strong></p></li></ul><h2>Difficulty Class</h2><p>The four standard DCs represent how difficult an action is.</p><p><strong>Easy, DC 9</strong>. Leaping a narrow chasm, sneaking up on an inattentive guard.</p><p><strong>Normal, DC 12</strong>. Kicking open a stuck door, picking a poor lock.</p><p><strong>Hard, DC 15.</strong> Swimming against a strong current, giving first aid to stop a character from dying.</p><p><strong>Extreme, DC 18</strong>. Climbing a slippery cliff one-handed, restraining a frenzied lion.</p><h2>Contested Checks</h2><p>If multiple creatures are working against each other on a conflicting task, an contested check decides who succeeds.</p><p>To make an contested check, each participant rolls one relevant stat check at the same time, even if it's not their turn. The highest result wins (reroll ties).</p>",
