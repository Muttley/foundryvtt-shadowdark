		"content": "<h2>Resting</h2><p>Injured characters can rest to recover from their wounds. To rest, a character must consume a ration and sleep for 8 hours.</p><p>Sleep can be broken up for light and routine tasks, such as taking a turn on watch.</p><p><strong>Interruption</strong>. Each stressful interruption of rest (including combat) requires an affected character to make a [[check 12 con]] check.</p><p>On a failure, the character consumes a ration but gains no benefit from resting.</p><p><strong>Success</strong>. A character who successfully rests regains all lost hit points and recovers any stat damage that was not permanent.</p><p>Additionally, some talents, spells, or items regain their ability to be used after a successful rest.</p><h2>Danger Level</h2><p>Characters can rest anywhere, but doing so inside a dungeon or perilous environment carries a high chance of failure due to the risk of a random encounter.</p><p>While the characters are resting in a dangerous environment, the Game Master checks for random encounters using the overland travel cadence:</p><p><strong>Unsafe</strong>. Check every 3 hours.</p><p><strong>Risky</strong>. Check every 2 hours.</p><p><strong>Deadly</strong>. Check every hour.</p><h2>Campfire</h2><p>In many cases, adventurers need a light source while resting. Characters can combine three torches into a campfire that can't be moved once lit.</p><p>A campfire lasts up to 8 hours while at least one character remains near to it, and it casts light out to a near distance.</p>",
