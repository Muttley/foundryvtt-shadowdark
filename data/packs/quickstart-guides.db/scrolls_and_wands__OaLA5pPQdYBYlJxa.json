		"content": "<h2>Using Scrolls and Wands</h2> <p>Scrolls and wands contain magic spells. Spellcasters can use them to cast these spells if the spell is on their spell list (even if they don't know the spell).</p> <p>To do so, they must succeed on a spellcasting check with a DC of <strong>10 + the tier</strong> of the spell contained in the wand or scroll.</p> <p><strong>Failing</strong> to cast a spell from a wand or scroll does not impact the ability to cast known spells.</p> <h2>Scrolls</h2> <p>After a spellcasting attempt with a scroll, the magical writing disappears from the scroll and it ceases to work. On a <strong>critical failure</strong>, casters with mishap tables must roll a mishap.</p> <h2>Wands</h2> <p>On a failed casting attempt, the wand stops working until you complete a rest. On a <strong>critical failure</strong>, the wand permanently breaks, and casters with mishap tables must roll a mishap.</p>",
