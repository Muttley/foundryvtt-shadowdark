Creatures can't hide while other creatures are able to see them, even at a casual glance.</p><p>It might also be impossible to hide if there's nowhere for a creature to stay out of sight.</p><h2>Detecting</h2><p>Detecting a hiding or sneaking creature requires the searcher to actively look or listen.</p><p>Looking in the right place automatically reveals a hidden creature. Otherwise, the searcher must succeed on a Wisdom check to perceive a hiding or sneaking creature.</p><h2>Surprise</h2><p>A creature who begins its turn undetected has the advantage of surprise. If combat hasn't started yet, those with surprise take one turn before the combat initiative roll (see Combat Initiative! on pg. 50).</p><p>A creature has advantage on attack rolls against surprised targets.</p><p>Attacking from hiding gives away the attacker's position afterwards unless the GM determines otherwise.</p>",
