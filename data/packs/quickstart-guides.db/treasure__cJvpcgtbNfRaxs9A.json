The rope groaned where it was wrapped around his waist and hands.</p><p>\"More slack!\" Ralina called up from inside the wide, square pit. Jorbin let a few more lengths slide by.</p><p>\"Not that much!\" Ralina shrieked a moment later.</p><p>The dwarf growled an oath and hauled the rope back.</p><p>Creeg sat cross-legged next to the pit and puffed on his pipe. \"Fifty gold the dwarf drops her,\" he said.</p><p>Iraga, a holy templar of Saint Terragnis, cast a disdainful look at the wizard. \"You know my beliefs on gambling,\" she said. She raised an index finger. \"One hundred gold, or you're a coward.\"</p><p>“I got it!\" Ralina shouted from below. Everyone scrambled to look.</p><p>At the bottom of the pit, the halfling stood before a black pedestal. She lifted a sparkling, grapefruit-sized sapphire overhead.</p><p>\"See?\" she said. \"And all of you stewing about traps—\"</p><p>Behind Ralina, a puff of air hissed. Everyone froze.</p><p>The pedestal sank into the floor with a clockwork grind; the pit's walls began trembling. A reverberating tick-tock picked up speed.</p><p>Creeg's shout broke the spell: “Get her out!\"</p><p>Iraga and Jorbin pulled up the rope in chaotic, frantic unison. The ticking hit a peak as Creeg reached down for Ralina's hand...</p><p>Boom! The pit's crushing walls slammed together.</p><p>Next to it, the four crawlers lied in a tangled heap.</p><p>\"Didn't even drop it,\" said Ralina's muffled voice.</p>",
