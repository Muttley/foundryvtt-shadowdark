		"content": "<h2>The Game Master</h2><p>The Game Master is the world- spinner, the all-wise, the ventriloquist.</p><p>You are the deadly pit trap and the assassin in the night. You are the storm. The army. The gods.</p><p>You hold ultimate power.</p><p>Yet you only want one thing: to see your players triumph.</p><p>So you craft malevolent villains worth defeating. You sculpt marvelous treasures worth stealing. You fill the world with rot, darkness, and death so it can be driven back by sword, spell, and flame.</p><p>Through this, you offer an invitation. You propose it loudly with roaring dragons, humbly with helpless villagers, secretly with hidden treasure maps.</p><p>You call the players to adventure.</p><p>And they answer.</p><h2>The Only Rule</h2><p>The Only Rule is that you make the rules.</p><p>What's written in this book is a guide, not a constraint, and none of it takes precedence over your judgment.</p><p>If something doesn't work at your table, change it or throw it out and don't look back.</p><h2>The Pact</h2><p>You and your players are gaming together to have fun, prop each other up, and strengthen bonds. This is The Pact.</p><p>The Pact is often unspoken and unseen, but it is always felt.</p><p>It is based on goodwill, respect, and fellowship.</p><p>Its enemies are selfishness, antagonism, and arrogance.</p><p>Decisions made to defend The Pact are always good ones.</p><h2>Setting DCs</h2><p>The four standard DCs of <strong>easy</strong> (9), <strong>normal</strong> (12), <strong>hard</strong> (15), and <strong>extreme</strong> (18) are universal and help you quickly decide a DC.</p><p>When determining the difficulty of a task, take the creature into account. Finding a trail in a sunny field would be an easy task for a forest elf with tracking skills, but it would be a hard task for a sun-dazzled cave troll.</p><p>When you ask players to make a check, state what kind of check it is. For example, an <em>easy Charisma check</em> or a <em>[[check 15 dex]] chec</em>k. That way, the players know what they need to roll to succeed.</p><h2>Challenge Variety</h2><p>The characters should face a multitude of challenges during an adventure, including combat, dealing with NPCs, or overcoming the environment.</p><p>Each class excels at different tasks. Thieves love to scout and talk to NPCs, fighters and clerics shine in combat, and wizards dominate the environment.</p><h2>Character Skill vs. Player Skill</h2><p>Characters aren't the only ones who level up. Players also gain experience!</p><p>For example, players will learn where to look for secret doors and what the \"tells\" are. As they go on more adventures, they become better at gameplay.</p><p>Encourage this by giving players the opportunity to make decisions that rely on their creativity and wits, not on their dice rolls or stat bonuses.</p><h2>Rules vs. Rulings</h2><p>If there were a rule for every situation, we would be living inside the rulebook instead of the game world.</p><p>As the GM, you have infinite power with only a handful of rules. Stat checks and the standard DCs can resolve any action. You need nothing more.</p><p>Rather than pore through the book, adjudicate using what you already know. Make a ruling, roll the dice, and keep going!</p>",
