		"content": "<p>If this is your first time playing <em><strong>Shadowdark RPG</strong></em>, it’s helpful to start with a premade character. Several adventurers are included with this book.</p><p>These <strong>quickstart rules</strong> cover beginner characters for their first few adventures. The full rules go much further; check them out at <a href=\"https://thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark\">thearcanelibrary.com/pages/shadowdark</a></p><h2>Characters</h2><p>You decide your character’s actions and tell them to the referee, or Game Master (<strong>GM</strong>).</p><p>The GM determines if your actions are successful and describes the results.</p><p>This back-and-forth between you, the GM, and your adventuring companions grows and shapes the game world.</p><p>Always ask yourself: If you were really your character, what would you do right now?</p><h2>Describe an Action</h2><p>On your <strong>turn</strong>, describe an <strong>action</strong> you want to do. For example, you could say you’re going to shoot your bow at a troll.</p><p>The GM might ask you to make a <strong>check</strong> (see Checks) to determine whether your action succeeds.</p><h2>Movement</h2><p>During your turn, you can <strong>move</strong> up to <strong>near</strong> (roughly 30 feet). You can break this movement up in any way. If you don’t take an action, you can move near again.</p><h2>Rounds</h2><p>Each person takes a turn, starting with the GM and going clockwise. The GM controls the monsters and environment and narrates how everyone’s actions change the game world.</p><p>Once everyone has taken a turn, that completes one <strong>round</strong>. Then, a new round begins.</p><h2>The Dice</h2><p>You'll need a four-sided (<strong>d4</strong>), six-sided (<strong>d6</strong>), eight-sided (<strong>d8</strong>), ten-sided (<strong>d10</strong>), twelve-sided (<strong>d12</strong>) and twenty-sided (<strong>d20</strong>) die.</p><p><strong>Multiples.</strong> 3d6 = three six-sided dice. Roll them together and add them.</p><p><strong>Advantage.</strong> Roll two times and use the higher result.</p><p><strong>Disadvantage.</strong> Roll two times and use the lower result.</p><h2>Stats</h2><p>Stats are your characteristics. Each stat goes from 3-18 and has a bonus or penalty (called a <strong>modifier</strong>, or MOD) from -4 to +4.</p><p><strong>Strength.</strong> Physical power.</p><p><strong>Dexterity.</strong> Agility, reflexes.</p><p><strong>Constitution.</strong> Endurance, resistance to injury.</p><p><strong>Intelligence.</strong> Logical ability.</p><p><strong>Wisdom.</strong> Instinct, willpower.</p><p><strong>Charisma.</strong> Appeal, presence.</p><h2>Checks</h2><p>When attempting a risky action, roll a d20 and add a modifier. That’s called making a <strong>check</strong>.</p><p>The GM chooses the check's linked stat and a number called a difficulty class (<strong>DC</strong>). If the total of your d20 roll + stat modifier equals or beats the DC, your action succeeds.</p><p>For example, the GM might say leaping over a narrow chasm requires a [[check 9 str]] check.</p><h2>Hit Points</h2><p>Injuries cause you to take <strong>damage</strong> and lose hit points (<strong>HP</strong>). Typical weapons deal 1d6 damage to your HP. You regain lost HP after a night of rest.</p><p>Characters at zero HP <strong>die</strong> in 1d4 + Constitution modifier (minimum 1) rounds. Dead characters are retired from play!</p><h2>What’s Next?</h2><p>You could play a whole game with just the basics. But once you're ready for more, the next chapters expand upon them.</p>",
