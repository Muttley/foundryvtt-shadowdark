Chaotic characters adopt a “survival of the fittest” mentality.</p><h2>Lawful</h2><p>Lawful characters align themselves with fairness, order, and virtue. Lawful characters operate from a “good of the whole” mentality.</p><h2>Neutral</h2><p>Neutral characters find balance between Law and Chaos. They align with the cycle of growth and decline, adopting a “nature must take its course” mentality.</p>",
