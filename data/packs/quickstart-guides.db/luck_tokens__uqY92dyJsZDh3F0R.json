You must use the new result.</p><p>You can also give your luck token to a companion.</p><h2>How Many to Give?</h2><p>The GM might award 2-3 new luck tokens per player during the course of a session with a pulpy, heroic feel.</p><p>Alternatively, the GM might not give out any new luck tokens during a game session that is grim, difficult, and dark.</p>",
