		"content": "<h2>Initiative</h2><p><em><strong>Shadowdark RPG</strong></em> is played in turn order right from the start.</p><p>At the beginning of the game, the GM establishes <strong>initiative</strong>, or the order in which the players act. Everyone rolls a d20 and adds their DEX modifier. The GM adds the highest DEX modifier of any monsters, if relevant.</p><p>The person who rolled the highest takes the first turn, and the turn order moves clockwise from that individual.</p><h2>Freeform Mode</h2><p>Initiative need not be strict; some GMs keep only a loose round-robin, allowing the players to decide their turn order and actions before circling back to the GM's turn.</p><p>Players might declare their actions as a group or act simultaneously, and the GM will need to adjudicate. A round passes once everyone has acted.</p><h2>Player Turn</h2><ol><li><p>The player counts down any personal timers for spells and other effects.</p></li><li><p>The player takes an action and may move up to near (split up in any way). The player can move near again if skipping an action.</p></li><li><p>The GM describes what happens as a result of the player's turn.</p></li></ol><h2>GM Turn</h2><ol><li><p>The GM counts down any timers not tracked by players.</p></li><li><p>The GM checks for a random encounter, if needed.</p></li><li><p>The GM takes actions and makes movements for any relevant creatures or environmental effects.</p></li><li><p>The GM describes what the characters notice as a result of steps 1-3.</p></li></ol>",
