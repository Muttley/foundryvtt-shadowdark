		"content": "<h2>Treasure</h2><p>Treasure is the driving force behind character advancement. Claiming treasure grants the characters XP and gives them valuable resources.</p><p><strong>Wandering Monsters</strong> have only a 50% chance of carrying treasure. They are poor sources of XP and valuables!</p><h2>Fleeting</h2><p>Carousing (<em><strong>Shadowdark RPG Core</strong></em>) allows PCs to gain XP fast, but they'll soon need to go adventuring again to replenish their empty pockets.</p><h2>Treasure Tables</h2><p>You can use treasure tables to randomly determine what loot a monster is carrying. The table the monster uses corresponds to its level. For example, a level 2 monster uses the @UUID[Compendium.shadowdark.rollable-tables.Pi9nnnLeXpTKCSMY]{Treasure 0-3}. <em><strong>Shadowdark RPG Core</strong></em> has tables for higher level monsters.</p><h2>Unguarded</h2><p>The GM can randomly generate unguarded treasure by rolling on the treasure table that matches the discovering character's level.</p><p>For example, a 6th-level wizard finds a treasure chest. The wizard rolls on the Treasure 4-6 table to determine what's inside.</p><h2>Dealing with Loot</h2><p>Treasure typically occupies one gear slot (coins occupy 1 slot per 100), but the GM might determine otherwise.</p><p>Characters can sell most treasure based on its material value, but they may need to find a curio collector to offload strange or obscure items.</p><h2>Magic Item Values</h2><p>Magic items can rarely be bought or sold. In such a case, weak magic items are worth [[/r 1d6*100]]{1d6 x 100 gp}. Powerful ones, if not priceless, are worth [[/r 2d6*100]]{2d6 x 100 gp}.</p>",
