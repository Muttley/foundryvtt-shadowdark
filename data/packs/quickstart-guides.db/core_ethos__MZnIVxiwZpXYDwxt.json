They don't have time to search every floor tile for a trap.</p><h2>Darkness</h2><p>Respect the darkness. It is the true foe. Few things can hold it at bay, and nothing must make those prized tools obsolete.</p><h2>Gear</h2><p>Gear is precious and limited. Give value and utility to all of it.</p><h2>Action Economy</h2><p>PCs get just one action per turn. Make it count. Use multitasking for boring small stuff.</p><h2>Information</h2><p>Dispense information freely. If the characters test the floor where there's a trap, they find it.</p><h2>Distance</h2><p>Close, near, and far distances are loose and don't require precise measurement. Nobody wants to miss firing an arrow into a dragon's eye because of a mere 5-foot deficit.</p><h2>Danger</h2><p>Casting spells comes with great risk. Magic items are volatile. Fights are fast and unfair. Monsters are insidious.</p><h2>Rewarding Investment</h2><p>Honor what has been earned. If a character learns a new language, make it matter. Allow new titles or iconic deeds to have an impact on the characters' lives.</p><h2>Checks</h2><p>The characters automatically succeed at what they are trained to do. Only use checks when</p><p>there is time pressure and failure has dire consequences.</p>",
