		"content": "<h2>Armor Class</h2><p>Just like characters, monsters have an <strong>AC</strong> that denotes how difficult it is to harm them.</p><h2>Hit Points</h2><p>Calculate a monster's hit points (<strong>HP</strong>) by rolling a number of d8s per monster level (<strong>LV</strong>) and adding its CON modifier (minimum 1). You can also use the average total listed.</p><h2>Attacks</h2><p>Most monsters can make one or two attacks per turn (<strong>ATK</strong>), but some can make more. Attack bonuses and damage are listed for each.</p><h2>Movement</h2><p>Monsters can typically move (<strong>MV</strong>) near each turn, but some can move other distances. If a monster has a special mode of movement, such as flying or swimming, it is noted after the distance.</p><h2>Stat Modifiers</h2><p>Monsters have modifiers listed for Strength (<strong>S</strong>), Dexterity (<strong>D</strong>), Constitution (<strong>C</strong>), Intelligence (<strong>I</strong>), Wisdom (<strong>W</strong>), and Charisma (<strong>Ch</strong>).</p><h2>Alignment</h2><p>All monsters have a typical alignment (<strong>AL</strong>) for their species. Individual monsters might have a different alignment.</p><h2>Spellcasting</h2><p>Treat monster spellcasting the same as character spellcasting. For a natural 1 on an INT or CHA spell, roll on the Wizard Mishap tables (pg. 46). A natural 1 on a WIS spell incurs penance. The <strong>tier</strong> is the spellcasting DC - 10.</p><h2>Dark-adapted</h2><p>All non-humanoid monsters are dark-adapted. Their powerful senses allow them to ignore the penalties of total darkness (see pg. 84). Blinding or deafening a monster still hinders it.</p>",
