An attack roll automatically hits and is a critical hit (see Damage on pg. 51).</p><h2>Natural 1</h2><p>When a d20 die roll shows a 1, what you're doing fails to your maximum capacity. An attack roll automatically misses and might even strike an ally.</p><h2>The D6 Decider</h2><p>If there's a random chance for an outcome, such as whether a dropped torch goes out, the GM calls for a d6 roll. A 1-3 results in the worse outcome for the players, and a 4-6 results in the better one.</p>",
