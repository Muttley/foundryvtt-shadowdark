You join a long and honored history of monumental gamers who have shaped countless imaginations. Their legacy is now yours.</p><p>As the Game Master, it is your job to lead the table in all things.</p><p>That means you set the bar. The way you speak, the energy you bring to the game, and the speed you set carries over to everyone else around you.</p><p>There will be times when you must guide a shy player, when you must firmly call for focus during off-topic chatter, and when you must declare in a hushed whisper that all fate hangs on the single roll of a die.</p><p>Do not shrink from your task. Even when all light is extinguished, all hit points gone, it is you who carries the torch.</p><h2>Your Eyes Only</h2><p>The core rules of Shadowdark RPG are found in the Player Quickstart Guide. You should refer to it for the main game rules alongside the players.</p><p>However, the material in this book, the Game Master Quickstart Guide, is for your eyes only.</p><p>The dire nature of monsters, the mysteries of magical treasure, and the fascinating secrets of adventuring sites are all things the characters should discover through gameplay.</p><p>There was never any fun had in knowing all the surprises before they happen!</p><h2>What to Do</h2><p>Describe what the characters newly perceive, and then let the players respond to that with actions. Call for checks when those actions require skill. Then start again from the top!</p>",
