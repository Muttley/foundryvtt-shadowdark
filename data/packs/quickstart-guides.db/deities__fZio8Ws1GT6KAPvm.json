A character may worship any deity, or none.</p><p><strong>Priests</strong> must choose one god to serve faithfully. A priest's deity can revoke the gift of spellcasting if the priest commits blasphemous acts.</p><p>Most folk worship one of <strong>The Four Lords</strong>, the lawful and neutral gods who stand for justice, order, and mercy.</p><p>Malevolent beings worship one of <strong>The Dark Trio</strong>, chaotic deities who evince power, destruction, and cruelty.</p><p>There were once nine primary gods, but two are <strong>The Lost</strong>, forbidden or forgotten.

She schemes to displace Ord so she can control the vast flow of magic herself.</p><h2>The Lost (?)</h2><p>Two of The Nine are lost to the ages, their names expunged from history and memory.
