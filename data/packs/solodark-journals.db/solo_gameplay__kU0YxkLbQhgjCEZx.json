		"content": "<p>Welcome to <em>SoloDark</em>, the solo gameplay rules for <em>Shadowdark RPG</em>!</p><p>As a solo player, you are both the characters and the Game Master.</p><p>And just like in any game, you don't want to know what's going to happen from the start. So you'll need a way to answer questions the GM would normally answer.</p><p>This booklet gives you roll tables to do just that:</p><h2>Oracle</h2><p>Use the Oracle to answer yes or no questions about the game world. Sometimes you'll get an unexpected answer or twist! See the table on pg. 10.</p><h2>Prompts</h2><p>Use prompts to spark ideas or answer open-ended questions. See the table on pg. 11. Roll a verb + noun to generate a result.</p><h2>Modified Rules</h2><p><em>SoloDark</em> modifies some of <em>Shadowdark RPG's</em> normal rules.</p><p><strong>Group Initiative.</strong> Choose one character and one enemy to make initiative checks on behalf of their respective groups.</p><p>You decide the order of actions on each group's turn. This can be different from round to round.</p><p><strong>Chaos Mode.</strong> Reroll initiative at the start of every combat round (use group initiative).</p><p><strong>Light.</strong> Light sources last 10 rounds each instead of 1 hour of real time.</p><p><strong>Luck.</strong> If you roll a natural 20, gain a luck token.</p><p>You can have as many luck tokens as you have PCs in your group.</p><p>Note you cannot reroll out-of-gameplay results with luck, such as Oracle checks or talent rolls.</p>",
