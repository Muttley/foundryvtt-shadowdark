If you have more than four, it can be hard to track.</p><p>If you want to have only one PC in your group, consider starting at a higher level.</p><h2>Jump In!</h2><p>You can head into a pre-written dungeon and use the Oracle to help decide your characters'choices. Or you can create an entirely new adventure from scratch (get ideas on pg. 7)!</p><p>See pg. 3-4 for gameplay examples and further resources.</p>",
