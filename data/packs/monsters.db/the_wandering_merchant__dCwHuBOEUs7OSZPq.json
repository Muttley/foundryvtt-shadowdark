He wears a white shirt, breeches, and leather apron, and he hauls a towering backpack bursting at the seams. Few know the merchant's true nature and origins, though some theorize he is an immortal being or a god (they are not entirely incorrect). The Wandering Merchant always has something useful, far-flung, or incredible to sell at a reasonable price, and there's no telling when or where he'll show up next... </i></p><br>\n\t\t\t<p>AC 16 (mithral chainmail), HP 71, ATK 4 +3 vorpal bastard sword +9 (1d10 + lop), MV near, S +3, D +3, C +4, I +3, W +4, Ch +5, AL L, LV 15</p><br>\n\t\t\t<p> Legendary.
